This directory is for assembling final builds of Classics Patch for every supported game version.

After the project solution is built, run AssembleBuilds.bat and it will first gather all needed files under dedicated game folders and then pack them into their own ZIP packages, suited for distribution.

The builds include a GRO package with patch resources for a specific game and original vanilla DLL files in the Bin directory that the patch replaces with its own.
